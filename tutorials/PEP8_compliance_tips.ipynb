    "This doesn't work for me, and I think it is because I am still using python 2.7, but if you have upgraded to python 3.x then it might work for you and would be really helpful.  From the examples I've seen, this cell magic will use the pep8 package to check the code in a notebook cell and identify everything that is not PEP8 compliant.  You can also do this yourself on a .py file from terminal using the pep8 package, but this magic would be much more convenient if you are already using python 3.  Get instructions here: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Extensions-Index#pep8  \n",
